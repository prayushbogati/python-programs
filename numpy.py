# MATRICES

# unlike arrays, matrices can't have more than 2 dimensions

# create matrices using np.array() or np.matrix()[not recommended though]
# matrices are special as they can have  * and ** operations between them

# using arrays there are methods like np.dot for matrix mul as np.matrix is not suggested 

# transposition using np.transpose()

# create identity matrix using np.eye(n) or np.identity(n)
